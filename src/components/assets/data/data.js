Technology plays a crucial role in our teaching methods, with the use of smart boards, online resources, and virtual labs. Our faculty is trained to use these methods effectively and provide our students with a dynamic learning experience. We believe that these methods not only enhance learning but also make it more engaging and enjoyable for students.
